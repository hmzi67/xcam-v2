# Google OAuth Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Authentication Configuration (`lib/auth-config.ts`)

**Added:**
- Google OAuth provider import
- Google OAuth provider configuration
- Enhanced callbacks for handling Google sign-in
- Automatic user creation for new Google OAuth users
- Profile creation for OAuth users

**Key Features:**
- Google accounts are automatically verified (no email verification needed)
- New users are created with "VIEWER" role by default
- User profiles are automatically created with Google profile information
- Last login timestamp is updated on each sign-in

### 2. Updated Login Form (`src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Functional Google OAuth button
- Proper callback URL handling
- Loading state for Google button

### 3. Updated Register Form (`src/components/auth/register-form.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Import for `signIn` from next-auth/react
- Functional Google OAuth button
- Loading state for Google button

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Created:**
- `.env.example` file with all required environment variables
- Documentation for Google OAuth setup

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **New User with Google:**
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
   - After authorization, user is created in database with:
     - Email from Google
     - Display name from Google profile
     - Avatar URL from Google profile
     - Email verified status set to `true`
     - Role set to "VIEWER"
   - User is redirected to the callback URL

2. **Existing User with Google:**
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - System checks if user exists by email
   - If user exists, they are signed in
   - Last login timestamp is updated

3. **Mixed Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up with credentials and later use Google OAuth
   - Users who signed up with Google can continue using Google OAuth
   - Email is the unique identifier across authentication methods

## Environment Variables Required

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Follow the guide in `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
2. Obtain Google OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
3. Add credentials to your `.env` file
4. Restart your development server

## Testing

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/login
# or
http://localhost:3000/register

# Click "Continue with Google" button
```

## Security Considerations

- Google OAuth users have their email automatically verified
- User data is stored securely in the database
- OAuth tokens are managed by NextAuth.js
- Session data is encrypted using JWT
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET should be kept secure and never committed

## Database Schema

The implementation works with the existing database schema:
- `User` table stores authentication data
- `Profile` table stores user profile information
- Both tables are automatically populated on Google OAuth sign-in

## Callback URLs

**Development:**
- `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

**Production:**
- `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

Make sure these URLs are added to your Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials.

## Troubleshooting

If Google OAuth is not working:
1. Check that environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Google Cloud Console configuration
3. Ensure redirect URIs match exactly
4. Check server logs for detailed error messages
5. Confirm database connection is working

## Next Steps

1. Configure Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
2. Add environment variables to `.env` file
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Update redirect URIs for production deployment
5. Consider adding error handling for edge cases
